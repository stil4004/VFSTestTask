# VFSTestTask

This is my realisation of virtual file system

## 1. To run Programm
To run programm use `main.exe`

To compile it write:
```g++ main.cpp VFS.h VFS.cpp -o main.exe```

(gcc should be installed)

## 2. A few words about realisation
Basic class sets at VFS.h. There you could find interface **IVFS** and structure of virtual File

Realisation of functions sets at VFS.cpp

Also i added some tests to main.cpp
